#  Openresty with  Sentry

## Requirements

 * Docker 1.10.0+
 * Compose 1.6.0+ _(optional)_

## Up and Running

Assuming you've just cloned this repository, the following steps
will get you up and running in no time!

There may need to be modifications to the included `docker-compose.yml` file to accommodate your needs or your environment. These instructions are a guideline for what you should generally do.

1. `docker volume create --name=sentry-data && docker volume create --name=sentry-postgres` - Make our local database and sentry volumes
    Docker volumes have to be created manually, as they are declared as external to be more durable.
2. `cp -n .env.example .env` - create env config file
3. `docker-compose build` - Build and tag the Docker services
4. `docker-compose run --rm web config generate-secret-key` - Generate a secret key.
    Add it to `.env` as `SENTRY_SECRET_KEY`.
5. `docker-compose run --rm web upgrade` - Build the database.
    Use the interactive prompts to create a user account.
6. `docker-compose up -d` - Lift all services (detached/background mode).
7. Access your instance at `localhost:9000`!
